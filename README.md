# WEB-Parser
This is WEB Parser, using ChromeDriver.
So if you have a list of pages, form where you need to grab some data - this parser will grab all the data you need automatically and save you a lot of your time and nerve cells! =)

P.S. The purpose of creating this parser is not to make a profit.
The parser was created for educational purposes, for students to give a presentation on the pet project of the site for joint viewing of films. =)
